**The Little Lighthouse Keeper**

On a rocky island at the edge of the world, there was a small lighthouse. It stood tall, its light flashing across the dark sea, warning sailors of the jagged cliffs that lay ahead. The keeper of this lighthouse was an old man named Elias. He had lived there alone for as long as he could remember, tending the light and ensuring it never went out.

Elias loved the solitude. The sound of the waves crashing against the rocks was his lullaby, and the stars above his only companions. But, one night, something unusual happened. A small, ragged boat appeared in the distance, bobbing through the dark waters, caught in the heavy fog. Elias hadn't seen a ship near the island in years.

Without hesitation, he grabbed his lantern and hurried down the narrow path to the beach. As the boat drew closer, he could see a figure slumped inside, barely awake. It was a young woman, pale and trembling.

Elias helped her onto the shore and wrapped her in his warm coat. She was shivering from cold and fear. 

“Thank you,” she whispered weakly. “I didn’t know where I was… The storm took me off course.”

Elias smiled gently. “You’re safe now. This island has a way of guiding lost souls.”

The woman stayed with Elias for several days, and over that time, they became close friends. She told him of her travels, of the vast cities she had seen and the family she had lost. Elias, in turn, shared the stories of the lighthouse and the peace he had found in the solitude of the sea.

When the weather cleared, the young woman said it was time for her to leave. She had to find her way back to her own life. But before she left, Elias gave her something precious—a small, silver compass that had once belonged to his father. 

"Whenever you're lost," he said softly, "remember this island, and it will guide you home."

She took the compass, smiling with tears in her eyes. Then, she boarded the boat and sailed off into the horizon.

Years passed, but Elias never forgot the young woman. Every time he would look at the compass, he would smile, knowing it had guided her to where she needed to go.

And though the island was still lonely, Elias was content. After all, he knew that even the smallest light could help guide someone to where they truly belonged.
